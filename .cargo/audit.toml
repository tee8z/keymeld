# Ignore serde_cbor unmaintained warning - acceptable risk for enclave environment
# AWS Nitro Enclaves crate also depends on it, and we're running in a secure enclave context
#
# Ignore RSA vulnerability in MySQL driver - we only use SQLite, never MySQL
# The vulnerable RSA crate is pulled in by sqlx-mysql but we never execute MySQL code paths
